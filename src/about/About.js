          The Cereal Guy coin is based on the famous Cereal Guy internet meme that emerged in 2023

           Cereal Guy is the most memeable memecoin in existence.

            It’s time for the Cereal Guy to take their reign as king of the memes.

            Remember: These dividends paid out to you are yours no matter what happens to the contract or the price of
            the tokens. Even if the value of the tokens plummets and everyone pulls out their money, that will only
            increase your earnings since you get them on every single sale.
